# The Price of Turning Away

You take a step back, the whisper of your name still rustling through the leaves. The forest pulses with a quiet magic, but something in your gut tugs hard—not yet.

Turning away, you walk along the tree line, keeping the shimmering woods in your peripheral vision. The further you go, the fainter the voices become, until they're gone altogether. A silence follows—thick, watchful.

Then, a flicker of movement at the corner of your eye. Not in the forest, but behind you.
