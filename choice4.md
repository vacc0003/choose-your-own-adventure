## Unsheath your sword and begin to march off the path knowing there is a looming presence that may bring danger.

You unsheath your sword, its cold weight a steady comfort as you step off the path and into the shadow-laced underbrush. Every tree seems to lean closer, their whispers twisting from your name into warnings, as the air thickens with the scent of moss and something ancient. A branch snaps ahead—too clean, too deliberate—and you tighten your grip, heart pounding as the looming presence stirs in the dark.

As you press forward, the forest seems to shift with your every step, branches parting just enough to lead you deeper, yet never quite showing what's ahead. A flicker of movement flashes between the trees—a tall, cloaked figure watching in perfect stillness, their face hidden in shadow. The whispering stops all at once, replaced by a heavy silence that feels like a held breath.

"You are in grave danger human. Do not continue forward if you value your mortal life."
