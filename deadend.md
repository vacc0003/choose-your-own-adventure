# Dead End: Enchanted Slumber

You step into the soft, glowing circle—and immediately everything goes still.  
Blue light swirls around you. Your eyelids grow heavy. A gentle whisper—like honey on the breeze—sings you to sleep.  

When you wake, the ring is gone, the oak stands silent, and you find yourself back at the forest’s edge, as if nothing happened.  

**THE END**
